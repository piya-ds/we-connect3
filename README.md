## extra info
- This project had to be restarted with 24 hours left in the hackathon. We faced a series of challenges that resulted in critical errors in the project.
- A deciscion was made to use a mobbing technique to restart and finish the project.  Creating a new project in this time frame was challenging and to get here is a great achievement as a team. 
- this has been a massive learning experience and we fell that it has given us a real life undeerstanding of the complexities of working on a framework in a collaborative and time controlled enviroment.
- Django UnHinged has worked well together in facing these issues and have learned more in these few days as a result!
